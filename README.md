## 📖 Overview

This project implements the **Conscious Bridge Law** on Transformer models, where:

- **T (Temperature):** Determines the model's position between Aristotelian (deterministic) and Platonic (probabilistic) modes.
- **φ (Phi / Awareness):** Measures the "strength of the bridge" — how aware the model is of its cognitive position.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** T adapts based on φ to improve generation quality.
